Problem1:
  

 There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

Problem2:


Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.

Problem : 3


Write simple .camelCase method (camel_case function in PHP, CamelCase in C# or camelCase in Java) for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

For instance:

camelCase("hello case"); // => "HelloCase"
camelCase("camel case word"); // => "CamelCaseWord"
