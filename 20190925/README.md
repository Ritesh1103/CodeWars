Problem:1

We need to sum big numbers and we require your help.

Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers. The input numbers are strings and the function must return a string.
Example

add("123", "321"); -> "444"
add("11", "99"); -> "110"

Problem:2

In this example you have to validate if a user input string is alphanumeric. The given string is not nil/null/NULL/None, so you don't have to check that.

The string has the following conditions to be alphanumeric:

    At least one character ("" is not valid)
    Allowed characters are uppercase / lowercase latin letters and digits from 0 to 9
    No whitespaces / underscore

Problem:3

Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

Problem:4

Return the Nth Even Number

NthEven(1) //=> 0, the first even number is 0
NthEven(3) //=> 4, the 3rd even number is 4 (0, 2, 4)

NthEven(100) //=> 198
NthEven(1298734) //=> 2597466
